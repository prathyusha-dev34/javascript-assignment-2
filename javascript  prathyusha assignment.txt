SECTION A: Technical Questions

1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

                             var	                        let	                                                    const
.var is an functional scoped/global scoped	. let is on the block scoped	                        . const is on the block scoped
.var allows redeclaration and reinitialization	.let allows reinitialization not accept redeclaration	. const not accept reuse, reinitialization, redeclaration
.var keyword used to declare variables	        . let is a modem keyword(Es6)	                        .const is used when the value should never change


2. Which keyword allows redeclaration and why?

  . var is function-scoped, not block scoped
  . JavaScript doesn't treat redeclaring a variable in the same scope as an error
        var x=10;
       var x=20;     console.log(x); // 20

3. Which keyword allows reinitialization?
 
  var and let

Reinitialization means assigning a new value to the same variable

 var a = 10;                 let b = 5;
 a = 20; // allowed            b= 15;   // allowed

4. Which keyword does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization?
  
   co . redeclaration is not allowed in the same scope.
 . reinitialization is not allowed after the first value is assigned.
 . const is block-scoped and meant for fixed values.

5. Why should const be used for fixed values?

   .const should be used for fixed values because it prevents the value from being changed accidentally
  .once assigned the value cannot be re-initialized

6. What error occurs when redeclaring a let variable?

  . redeclaring a let variable causes a syntax error
   let a= 10;  
   let a= 20;// syntax error


7. What error occurs when reassigning a const variable?

  . An error occurs reassigning a const variable is type error
     const x=10;
      x=20;// type error

8 Which keyword is preferred in modern JavaScript and why?

    const

. Block scoped
. values cannot be reassigned so code is safer
  const pi = 3.14;

9. Can const be declared without initialization? Explain.

   .No , a const variable cannot be declared without initialization in java script

 java script throws this error:
 syntax error: missing initializer in const declaration

10. When should var be avoided?

    . var should be avoided in modem java script because it is not block scoped and allows
      redeclaration, leading to bugs
   .In modern ES6+ code let and const are safer and clearer

SECTION B: Code-Based Questions

11. Predict the output:

var a = 10;
a = 20;
var a = 30;
console.log(a);

//output is 30

12. Predict the output:

let b = 5;
b = 15;
console.log(b);

//output is 15

13. Identify the error:

let x = 10;
let x = 20;

//syntax error

14. Identify the error:

const y = 50;
y = 100;

//type error

15. Write a program using var to show redeclaration.

     var name='Lavanya';
     var name='Prathyusha';
    console.log(name);

// output is: prathyusha

16. Write a program using let to show reinitialization.

     let number = 10;

    console.log(number);
    number = 25;
    console.log(number);

output 10
       25

17. Write a program using const and explain why value cannot change.

const pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi);

pi=3.1459; // trying to change the value

output: Type error
assignment to constant variable

18. Convert var to let where applicable.
    
     var count=4;
       
      if(count>1){
        
        var valid=4;
   }
   
   console.log(valid, 'is valid')

       //var is function-scope, we can use outside the block
 
  let count=4;

  if(count>1){

     let valid=4;

     console.log(valid, "is valid")
     
   } 
       //let is block- scope, we can use only inside the block 
  
19. Convert var to const where applicable.
     
     var sub='telugu';
     var lesson=10;
     console.log(sub, lesson);

 // var convert to const
  
     const sub='telugu';
     const lesson=10;
     console.log(sub, lesson);

20. Write your own example for var, let, and const.
 
     var city = "Hyderabad";
     var city = "Bangalore";// redeclaration allowed
      city = "Chennai";    //  reinitialization allowed

     console.log(city);
   
    let month = January;
        month = February;//reinitialization allowed

     console.log(month);


    const country =" India";
    
    console.log(country);
